## Approved Exceptions

Packages with non-permissive licenses that have been manually reviewed and approved. See `packages/electron/build/license-approvals.json` for the source of truth.

- **@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.2.126** (Anthropic Commercial): Anthropic commercial license (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance). Permits use by developers writing code locally, which is exactly how Nimbalyst integrates the SDK. Used unmodified.
- **elkjs@0.11.1** (EPL-2.0): Eclipse Public License 2.0. Bundled unmodified as a JavaScript library. EPL-2.0 is a file-level weak copyleft that permits this without affecting Nimbalyst's licensing; only modifications to elkjs itself would need to be released under EPL-2.0.
- **libheif-js@1.19.8** (LGPL-3.0): GNU Lesser GPL 3.0. Bundled unmodified as a JavaScript module loaded at runtime from node_modules; users can substitute their own build. License text is included in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt. No copyleft contagion to Nimbalyst's source.
